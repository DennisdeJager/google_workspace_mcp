"""
VS Code Compatibility Middleware for OAuth 2.1

This middleware provides transparent path normalization to support VS Code's MCP client
OAuth behavior without requiring redirects. It rewrites VS Code's non-standard paths
to canonical OAuth 2.1 discovery endpoints.

Key features:
- Transparent path rewriting from /mcp/.well-known/* to /.well-known/*
- VS Code client detection utilities
- No performance overhead from HTTP redirects
- Maintains OAuth 2.1 compliance while accommodating VS Code quirks
